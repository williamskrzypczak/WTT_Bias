# Cursor Rules for WTT_Bias Project

## Code Maintenance

After each new feature request, scan the code for any redundant or unused code. This includes:
- Unused variables
- Commented-out code blocks
- Duplicate functions or logic
- Unreachable code paths
- Dead code that is no longer needed after refactoring

Remove or refactor any redundant code to keep the codebase clean and maintainable.
